			<p>Dearest GitHub, <br><br>
			
			I have to admit, you intimidate me. You are social platform that gives me access to a vast network of web developers and coders who can instantly access my files, and I can access theirs, and with that I have a level of reservation. Your beauty however, far outweighs my doubts. Your collaborative nature is one to be admired and sought after, and while I am not quite there yet, you are teaching me to be a better developer. </p>

			<p>Our relationship began at the signup page - <a href="https://github.com/">(you can access that page here).</a> From here, our relationship started slowly; I'm not one to jump into anything too quickly. I have to admit though, I was rather taken by your simple exterior, just begging me to look deeper. As with any web project, we started with the <span>"new repository" button,</span> which we then followed the prompts to enter information about the repository. From here we can follow the UNIX git commands to create local copies of the repository. (You can access my git love letter for more information on this part<a href="../dev/git-love-letter/index.html"> here.</a></p>

			<p>Once we have repositories set up, we can acces each one from our profile home page. If we click into a respoitory we have all sorts of options. One of the most enticing buttons is the one called<span>"fork."</span> This button is how collaboration with other developers starts; you can make requests on others' projects and they can make a request to pull yours. From here the repository is cloned and "forked," this way both people can work on the repository and save their changes separately. Once the user who requested a pull has an awesome update, they can submit a </p<span>"new pull request"</span> in order to show the owner the changes, and see if they want to integrate them. </p>

			<p>To be honest, GitHub, our relationship is still young. While I could see a bright future with you, we are just now getting to know one another. Once we understand each other better I will write again. 
			</p>

				<p>Love, <br> Caitlin</p>
